I made a work of art with what i learned in class.My inspiration comes from movies<cube>.so i want create a large cube can go everywhere and if you get into this cube you will lose and have danger.
On this basis of idea I created a scene by code and a model of a cube which x.y,z axis all 18. There are many small cubes on the large cube. My original idea was that clicking on each small cube could change their color, but I didn't know how to set it. So I could only click on the big cube to change his color.
On this display platform, besides adding scenes, cameras, renderers and models, I also added light. These include a spotLight and a dirLight.Then set the cube's inertial mouse sensitivity, zoom, rotate, drag and drop to change perspective.finally set random colors
