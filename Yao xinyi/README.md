I made a work of art. I created a scene by code. I created a model of a cube. There are many small cubes on the cube. My original idea was that clicking on each small cube could change their color, but I didn't know how to set it. So I could only click on the big cube to change his color. Then I used the method of teaching in class to make his perspective come and Back conversion.And you can adjust his speed.
