I often wonder why time can't be controlled, for example, if you regret doing something, you can go back and start over. If you want time to stop, time will stop.
â€‹But this is a very macro concept, and I want to make it more specific. This is a scene where an electric fan is turning, and this fan is like time. I wanted to use clocks to represent it, but it seems a little too common, and fans can give people a feeling of breeze blowing, like time, you may not feel the gentle passing. Colorful particles will fall around us, which symbolize the things we usually experience, big or small, happy or sad.At first the fans rotate and the colorful particles fall from the sky, which indicates normal time flow. If you click on the fan, it will stop turning, which means time stops. Then click on the fan and it will turn again. The particles will fly from the ground to the sky, which represents the reverse of time. If you want to return to normal time, just click on the fan again.I used a fan's 3D Max model. If the mouse moves, there will be snowflakes, which represents emotions, emotions let us want to go back to the past or stop the event or return to the right track. However, even if life is sometimes unhappy, there are still good things to fight for. I think snow is beautiful, so I created the snowflake label and moved to follow it. Index.js has a snowflake instance at the top, which is not a model but a text.
